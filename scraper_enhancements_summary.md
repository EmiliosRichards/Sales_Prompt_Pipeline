# Summary of Scraper Enhancements

This document outlines the key enhancements made to the web scraping module to improve its robustness and reliability.

### 1. User-Agent Rotation

To prevent websites from identifying the scraper as a bot, we implemented User-Agent rotation. This makes each request appear as if it's coming from a different browser.

*   **Configuration**:
    *   Added a `SCRAPER_USER_AGENTS` variable to the `.env` and `.env.example` files. This variable holds a comma-separated list of User-Agent strings.
*   **Implementation**:
    *   The scraper logic in `src/scraper/scraper_logic.py` was updated to randomly select a User-Agent from this list for each scraping session.

### 2. Custom Request Headers

To further mimic the behavior of a real browser, we added the ability to send custom HTTP headers with each request.

*   **Configuration**:
    *   Added a `SCRAPER_DEFAULT_HEADERS` variable to the `.env` and `.env.example` files. This variable holds a JSON string of key-value pairs for the headers (e.g., `Accept-Language`, `Referer`).
*   **Implementation**:
    *   The scraper now parses this JSON string and applies these headers to every request it makes.

### 3. Headed Browser Mode (for Debugging)

To bypass more advanced anti-bot measures, we enabled the option to run the scraper in "headed" mode, which opens a visible browser window.

*   **Implementation**:
    *   The `headless` parameter in `src/scraper/scraper_logic.py` was set to `False`. While this didn't solve the issue with the most difficult site, it remains a valuable debugging tool and can be effective against less sophisticated anti-scraping techniques.
