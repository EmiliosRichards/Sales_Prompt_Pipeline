Based on the [Website Summary Text], extract the following information:

*   `company_size_indicators_text`: (string or null) Quote or describe textual clues from the summary that indicate company size (e.g., "summary mentions serving large enterprise clients", "described as a startup in the summary").
*   `company_size_category_inferred`: (string or null) Infer a company size category based on the summary (e.g., "Startup", "SME", "Large Enterprise", "Unknown/Not Specified").
*   `innovation_level_indicators_text`: (string or null) Quote or describe textual clues from the summary about the company's innovation level or focus (e.g., "summary highlights use of innovative workshops", "AI-supported solutions mentioned in summary").
*   `website_clarity_notes`: (string or null) Brief notes on how clearly the business model and target group are communicated, based *only* on the provided summary.

You MUST provide a value for every field listed. If you cannot determine a value from the summary, use `null` for optional fields, an empty string `""` for required string fields, or an empty list `[]` for required list fields. Do not omit any fields from the final JSON object.

Example JSON structure (ensure all fields above are included in your actual response):
{
  "input_summary_url": "[PROGRAMMATIC_PLACEHOLDER]",
  "b2b_indicator": true,
  "phone_outreach_suitability": true,
  "target_group_size_assessment": "Appears Medium",
  "industry": "Software Development",

  "innovation_level_indicators_text": "Summary highlights investment in R&D and new AI features.",
  "website_clarity_notes": "Business model and target audience are clearly articulated in the summary."
}

Remember, the entire response must be ONLY the JSON object.
The "input_summary_url" field is a placeholder; your LLM response should generate all other fields based on the [Website Summary Text].
