Office 2024 is sold as a one-time purchase, which means you pay a single, up-front cost to get Office apps for one computer. One-time purchases are available for both PCs and Macs. However, there are no upgrade options, which means if you plan to upgrade to the next major release, you'll have to buy it at full price. Microsoft 365 Personal and Microsoft 365 Family are subscriptions that include powerful productivity apps and creativity tools with AI-powered features. In addition to premium desktop versions of popular Microsoft 365 apps like Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and Outlook, you also get spacious cloud storage and cloud-connected features that let you collaborate on files in real time. With a subscription, you'll always have the latest features, fixes, and security updates along with ongoing tech support at no extra cost. You can choose to pay for your subscription on a monthly or yearly basis, and use your apps on multiple PCs, Macs, tablets, and phones. Additionally, the Microsoft 365 Family plan lets you share your subscription with up to five more people. Everyone gets their own apps and storage. (AI features only available to subscription owner and cannot be shared; AI usage limits apply; minimum age limits may apply to subscription activation and use of AI features. Learn more .)

See system requirements for compatible versions of your devices, and for other feature requirements. Will Microsoft 365 be identical on a PC and on a Mac? No. Microsoft 365’s applications are tailored for each platform and each operating system. The applications available for Mac users and the specific features included may be different from those available for PC users. With Microsoft 365, you can be flexible. With your account, you are not limited to exclusively Mac or exclusively PC, so you can transition across devices. Do I keep control of my documents with a Microsoft 365 subscription? Yes. Documents that you have created belong fully to you. You can choose to store them online on OneDrive or locally on your PC or Mac. Is internet access required for Microsoft 365? Internet access is required to install and activate all the latest releases of apps and services included in all Microsoft 365 subscription plans.

Internet access is also required to access documents stored on OneDrive, unless you install the OneDrive desktop app . You should also connect to the internet regularly to keep your version of Microsoft 365 up to date and to benefit from automatic upgrades. If you do not connect to the internet at least every 31 days, your apps will go into reduced functionality mode, which means that you can view or print your documents but cannot edit the documents or create new ones. To reactivate your apps, simply reconnect to the internet. You do not need to be connected to the internet to use the Office apps, such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, because the apps are fully installed on your computer.
