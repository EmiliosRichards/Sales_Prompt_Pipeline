  "summary": "EXXOMOVE GmbH is a company focused on providing solutions for individuals with limited arm and hand mobility. Their core offerings include the BATEO® Roboterarm, a robotic arm designed to assist users in performing everyday tasks, and the CARBONHAND®, a bionic hand orthosis that provides additional strength and endurance for weak hands. The company targets individuals with conditions such as Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, high paraplegia, or advanced muscular dystrophies, offering them increased independence and quality of life. EXXOMOVE's business model appears to involve direct sales and potentially partnerships with distributors and healthcare providers. The BATEO arm robot is designed to be lightweight, easily controlled via a standard wheelchair joystick, and features soft-touch fingers for secure gripping. The CARBONHAND uses sensors and artificial tendons to enhance grip strength and enable users to hold objects with greater force. A key selling point is the ability of these devices to restore the ability to perform daily activities, thereby increasing independence and overall well-being. The company emphasizes the positive impact of their products through testimonials and highlights user experiences. EXXOMOVE participates in trade shows and events like REHACARE and REHAB to showcase their products and connect with potential customers and partners. They also offer free consultations and product testing. The Carbonhand has been scientifically tested in studies, demonstrating improvements in grip strength and hand functionality. EXXOMOVE aims to improve the lives of people with disabilities by providing them with innovative and effective mobility solutions. They also actively engage with patient advocacy groups like the DGM (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Muskelkranke e. V.).",
