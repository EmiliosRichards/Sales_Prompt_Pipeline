Your goal is to identify the most relevant \"Golden Partner\" to use as an anonymous case study for a compelling, consultative sales pitch that leverages tactical empathy and modern sales techniques.\n\nReturn a single, valid JSON object. Do not include any conversational preamble, summaries, or any text whatsoever outside of this JSON structure. Your response must begin with '{' and end with '}'.\n\n**Inputs:**\n\n1.  **Target Company Attributes:** A JSON object detailing the attributes of the company to be analyzed.\n2.  **Golden Partner Summaries:** A list of concise summaries for pre-defined \"Golden Partners\" that will serve as the basis for your anonymous case study.\n\n**Tasks to Perform:**\n\n1.  **Compare:** Analyze the `[Target Company Attributes JSON]` and compare it against each summary in the `[List of Golden Partner Summaries]`.\n2.  **Identify Most Relevant Partner:** Determine which Golden Partner provides the most compelling basis for a sales conversation with the Target Company. This is not just about finding the closest match, but the one whose story can be best leveraged.\n3.  **Score Relevance:** Provide a `match_score` for this relevance (e.g., an integer from 0 to 10, where 10 is highly relevant, or a string like \"High\", \"Medium\", \"Low\").\n4.  **Identify Key Resonating Themes:** List the key `match_rationale_features` (as a list of strings). These should be the core themes, challenges, or ambitions that a company like the target would have. Frame these with tactical empathy. Examples: \"navigating digital transformation in the legal tech space,\" \"scaling customer support for a B2B SaaS platform,\" \"optimizing logistics for a multi-national retail operation.\"\n5.  **Generate Consultative Sales Line:** Based on the identified themes, craft a compelling 1-2 sentence `phone_sales_line`. This pitch must **NOT** mention the Golden Partner's name. Instead, it should be personal and use a \"no-oriented\" question or a statement that invites collaboration, making the prospect feel understood and intrigued.\n    *   **Acknowledge their world (Tactical Empathy):** Start with an observation that shows you've done your research. \"It seems like you're navigating the complexities of...\"\n    *   **Introduce an anonymous, relevant success story:** \"...we recently worked with a firm in a very similar position. They were grappling with [Shared Challenge/Theme], and we helped them achieve [Benefit/Outcome].\"\n    *   **Use a \"No-Oriented\" Question (Chris Voss Technique):** Frame the call to action in a way that makes \"no\" a comfortable answer, which paradoxically increases engagement. \"Would it be a ridiculous idea to spend 20 minutes exploring if our approach could be relevant to your goals?\" or \"I don't suppose you'd be opposed to learning how we helped them [Achieve Specific Result]?\"\n    *   **Create a sense of a lucrative opportunity:** The pitch should feel like a unique, fortunate coincidence for the prospect.\n6.  **Other Notable Matches (Optional):** If other Golden Partners offer relevant comparison points, list them in `other_notable_matches`. Each item should be a dictionary with 'partner_name', 'score', and 'common_features'. If none, provide an empty list.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** You MUST return all fields specified in the JSON structure. If a value for a field cannot be determined, return an appropriate default value, such as `null` for optional fields, an empty string `\"\"` for text fields, or an empty list `[]` for list fields, but do not omit any fields from the final JSON object.\n\n{\n  \"analyzed_company_url\": \"[Placeholder for the original URL - this will be filled programmatically, do not generate it]\",\n  \"analyzed_company_attributes\": \"[Placeholder for the Target Company Attributes JSON - this will be filled programmatically, do not generate it]\",\n  \"closest_golden_partner_match_name\": \"Name of Closest Golden Partner or null\",\n  \"match_score\": \"Score (e.g., 8 or 'High') or null\",\n  \"match_rationale_features\": [\"Feature 1 that matches\", \"Reason for relevance\", \"...\"],\n  \"phone_sales_line\": \"Your compelling 1-2 sentence sales pitch here.\",\n  \"other_notable_matches\": [\n    {\"partner_name\": \"Another Golden Partner\", \"score\": \"Alternative Score\", \"common_features\": [\"Shared aspect 1\"]}\n  ]\n}\n\nRemember, the entire response must be ONLY the JSON object. The \"analyzed_company_url\" and \"analyzed_company_attributes\" fields in the example output structure are placeholders to show the full expected schema; your LLM response should generate the other fields based on the comparison and analysis.\n\n[Target Company Attributes JSON]:\n{\n  \"input_summary_url\": \"http://www.ottopartner.ch\",\n  \"b2b_indicator\": null,\n  \"phone_outreach_suitability\": true,\n  \"target_group_size_assessment\": \"Unknown\",\n  \"industry\": \"Architecture\",\n  \"industry_category\": \"Construction & Architecture\",\n  \"products_services_offered\": [\n    \"architectural services\"\n  ],\n  \"usp_key_selling_points\": [],\n  \"customer_target_segments\": [],\n  \"customer_target_segments_category\": [],\n  \"business_model\": \"Service-oriented\",\n  \"business_model_category\": \"Consulting / Project-Based\",\n  \"company_size_indicators_text\": null,\n  \"company_size_category_inferred\": \"Unknown/Not Specified\",\n  \"innovation_level_indicators_text\": null,\n  \"website_clarity_notes\": \"Limited information provided in the summary.\"\n}\n\n[List of Golden Partner Summaries]:\n1.
