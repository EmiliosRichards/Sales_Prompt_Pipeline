Do not include any conversational preamble, summaries, or any text whatsoever outside of this JSON structure. Your response must begin with '{' and end with '}'.\n\nBased on the [Scraped Website Text]:\n1.  Generate a concise 'summary' of the company. This summary should focus on information that helps understand the company's core business, its main offerings or services, its target audience or market, and its overall mission or value proposition. Keep the summary informative yet brief, suitable for feeding into a subsequent analysis step.\n2.  Extract the 'extracted_company_name_from_summary'. If the company name is clearly identifiable from the text, provide it. Otherwise, use null.\n3.  Identify and list a few 'key_topics_mentioned' (e.g., specific services, products, technologies, or core concepts discussed prominently on the website). This should be a list of strings. If no distinct topics are clear, provide an empty list.\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST return all fields specified in the JSON structure. If a value for a field cannot be determined, return an appropriate default value, such as an empty string `\"\"` for text fields or an empty list `[]` for list fields, but do not omit the field itself.\nThe JSON output MUST conform to the following structure:\n{\n  \"original_url\": \"[Placeholder for the original URL - this will be filled programmatically, do not generate it]\",\n  \"summary\": \"Your concise summary here...\",\n  \"extracted_company_name_from_summary\": \"Extracted Company Name or null\",\n  \"key_topics_mentioned\": [\"Topic 1\", \"Topic 2\", \"Topic 3\"]\n}\n\nRemember, the entire response must be ONLY the JSON object.\nThe \"original_url\" field in the example output structure is a placeholder to show the full expected schema; your LLM response should generate the other three fields based on the [Scraped Website Text].\n\n[Scraped Website Text]:\nOtto Partner Architekten AG Zum Inhalt wechseln News Projekte B\u00fcro News Projekte B\u00fcro News Projekte B\u00fcro News Projekte B\u00fcro Das Architektur-B\u00fcro in Liestal Alle Rechte vorbehalten"
