  "summary": "EXXOMOVE GmbH is a company focused on providing solutions for individuals with limited arm and hand mobility. Their core offerings include the BATEO® robotic arm and the CARBONHAND® bionic hand orthosis. The BATEO® robotic arm is designed to assist individuals with limited arm movement in performing everyday tasks, offering a greater range of motion and independence. It is lightweight, easily controlled via a standard wheelchair joystick, and features soft-touch fingers for secure gripping. The CARBONHAND® is a microprocessor-controlled bionic hand that provides additional strength and endurance for weak hands. It strengthens existing grip, allowing users to hold and lift objects with increased ease. Sensors in the fingertips respond to minimal pressure changes, reinforcing grip. The Carbonhand orthosis directly compensates for disabilities. Both products are aimed at improving the quality of life for people with conditions like Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, high spinal cord injuries, or advanced muscular dystrophy. EXXOMOVE targets individuals with disabilities affecting upper limb mobility, as well as therapists, caregivers, and healthcare professionals involved in rehabilitation and assistive technology. They participate in trade shows like REHACARE and REHAB to showcase their products. The company also emphasizes scientific validation, with the CARBONHAND having been studied extensively, demonstrating improved grip strength and hand functionality. EXXOMOVE provides consultations and product testing to potential users. Their stated goal is to enable a self-determined life through smart arm and hand mobility solutions. They offer a newsletter service, and provide PDF documents containing information about the BATEO and CARBONHAND products, as well as studies related to the CARBONHAND. EXXOMOVE also collaborates with organizations like the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Muskelkranke e. V. (DGM) and EnableMe to reach their target audience and provide resources. They highlight user testimonials and success stories to showcase the impact of their products.",
