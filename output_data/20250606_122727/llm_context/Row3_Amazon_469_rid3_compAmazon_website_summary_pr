Your primary task is to process the provided [Scraped Website Text] and return a single, valid JSON object. Do not include any conversational preamble, summaries, or any text whatsoever outside of this JSON structure. Your response must begin with '{' and end with '}'.

Based on the [Scraped Website Text]:
1.  Generate a concise 'summary' of the company. This summary should focus on information that helps understand the company's core business, its main offerings or services, its target audience or market, and its overall mission or value proposition. Keep the summary informative yet brief, suitable for feeding into a subsequent analysis step.
2.  Extract the 'extracted_company_name_from_summary'. If the company name is clearly identifiable from the text, provide it. Otherwise, use null.
3.  Identify and list a few 'key_topics_mentioned' (e.g., specific services, products, technologies, or core concepts discussed prominently on the website). This should be a list of strings. If no distinct topics are clear, provide an empty list.

IMPORTANT: You MUST return all fields specified in the JSON structure. If a value for a field cannot be determined, return an appropriate default value, such as an empty string `""` for text fields or an empty list `[]` for list fields, but do not omit the field itself.
The JSON output MUST conform to the following structure:
{
  "original_url": "[Placeholder for the original URL - this will be filled programmatically, do not generate it]",
  "summary": "Your concise summary here...",
  "extracted_company_name_from_summary": "Extracted Company Name or null",
  "key_topics_mentioned": ["Topic 1", "Topic 2", "Topic 3"]
}

Remember, the entire response must be ONLY the JSON object.
The "original_url" field in the example output structure is a placeholder to show the full expected schema; your LLM response should generate the other three fields based on the [Scraped Website Text].

Read more Report Nikolaus 5.0 out of 5 stars Rennspaß im Miniaturformat Reviewed in Germany on May 17, 2025 Verified Purchase Für unser zukünftiges Patenkind haben wir dieses Hot Wheels Formel 1 Set gekauft und finden: Das ist ein tolles Geschenk für kleine Rennsport-Fans. Auch wenn nicht alle Top-Teams enthalten sind, bietet das Set dennoch jede Menge Spielspaß und sieht klasse aus. --Verarbeitung & Design-- Die fünf enthaltenen F1-Modelle im Maßstab 1:64 sind sauber verarbeitet und haben eine schöne Lackierung. Die Team-Dekorationen orientieren sich an aktuellen Rennställen wie RB, Haas, Alpine oder McLaren. Sie wirken stimmig und machen sich auch gut in einer kleinen Vitrine, nicht nur auf der Rennbahn. --Spielwert & Sammelfaktor-- Die Fahrzeuge rollen gut, sind robust gebaut und damit absolut kindertauglich. Wer Hot Wheels Tracks besitzt, kann die Autos natürlich auch dort einsetzen. Für kleine Kinder zählt ohnehin mehr, wie bunt und cool die Autos aussehen, und das erfüllen diese hier allemal. --Fazit & Empfehlung-- Ein rundes 5er-Pack für Sammler und Kinder gleichermaßen. Auch wenn die ganz großen Namen wie Red Bull oder Ferrari fehlen, ist das Set als Geschenk oder Ergänzung zur Spielzeugsammlung eine gute Wahl. Die Mischung aus bekannten und neueren Teams bringt Abwechslung ins Spiel.
