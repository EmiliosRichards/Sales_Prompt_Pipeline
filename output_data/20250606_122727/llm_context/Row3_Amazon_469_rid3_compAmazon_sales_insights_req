Based on this, you will identify the closest matching Golden Partner, provide a match score and rationale, and generate a tailored phone sales pitch for the Target Company. Return a single, valid JSON object. Do not include any conversational preamble, summaries, or any text whatsoever outside of this JSON structure. Your response must begin with '{' and end with '}'.\n\n**Inputs:**\n1.  **Target Company Attributes:** A JSON object detailing the attributes of the company to be analyzed.\n2.  **Golden Partner Summaries:** A list of concise summaries for pre-defined \"Golden Partners\".\n\n**Tasks to Perform:**\n1.  **Compare:** Analyze the `[Target Company Attributes JSON]` and compare it against each summary in the `[List of Golden Partner Summaries]`.\n2.  **Identify Closest Match:** Determine which Golden Partner is the closest match or most relevant for comparison to the Target Company.\n3.  **Score Match:** Provide a `match_score` for this closest match (e.g., an integer from 0 to 10, where 10 is a strong match, or a string like \"High\", \"Medium\", \"Low\").\n4.  **Rationale & Features:** List the key `match_rationale_features` (as a list of strings) that make the Target Company similar to the identified closest Golden Partner, or explain the relevance of the comparison.\n5.  **Generate Sales Line:** Based *only* on the `[Target Company Attributes JSON]`, craft a compelling 1-2 sentence `phone_sales_line` that could be used when calling the Target Company. This sales line should highlight aspects of their profile that align with potential needs or interests.\n6.  **Other Notable Matches (Optional):** If there are other Golden Partners that are also notably similar (but not the primary match), you can list them in `other_notable_matches`. Each item in this list should be a dictionary with 'partner_name', 'score', and 'common_features'. If none, provide an empty list.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: You MUST return all fields specified in the JSON structure. If a value for a field cannot be determined, return an appropriate default value, such as `null` for optional fields, an empty string `\"\"` for text fields, or an empty list `[]` for list fields, but do not omit any fields from the final JSON object.\n{\n  \"analyzed_company_url\": \"[Placeholder for the original URL - this will be filled programmatically, do not generate it]\",\n  \"analyzed_company_attributes\": \"[Placeholder for the Target Company Attributes JSON - this will be filled programmatically, do not generate it]\",\n  \"closest_golden_partner_match_name\": \"Name of Closest Golden Partner or null\",\n  \"match_score\": \"Score (e.g., 8 or 'High') or null\",\n  \"match_rationale_features\": [\"Feature 1 that matches\", \"Reason for relevance\", \"...\"],\n  \"phone_sales_line\": \"Your compelling 1-2 sentence sales pitch here.\",\n  \"other_notable_matches\": [\n    {\"partner_name\": \"Another Golden Partner\", \"score\": \"Alternative Score\", \"common_features\": [\"Shared aspect 1\"]}\n  ]\n}\n\nRemember, the entire response must be ONLY the JSON object.\nThe \"analyzed_company_url\" and \"analyzed_company_attributes\" fields in the example output structure are placeholders to show the full expected schema; your LLM response should generate the other fields based on the comparison and analysis.\n\n[Target Company Attributes JSON]:\n{\n  \"input_summary_url\": \"https://www.amazon.com\",\n  \"b2b_indicator\": true,\n  \"phone_outreach_suitability\": false,\n  \"target_group_size_assessment\": \"Appears Large / >=500 potential\",\n  \"industry\": \"E-commerce\",\n  \"industry_category\": \"Retail & Wholesale\",\n  \"products_services_offered\": [\n    \"E-commerce platform\",\n    \"Online retail\",\n    \"Digital streaming (Prime Video, Amazon Music)\",\n    \"E-books (Kindle)\",\n    \"Cloud computing (AWS)\",\n    \"Third-party seller services\"\n  ],\n  \"usp_key_selling_points\": [\n    \"Vast selection\",\n    \"Competitive pricing\",\n    \"Customer convenience\"\n  ],\n  \"customer_target_segments\": [\n    \"Consumers (B2C)\",\n    \"Businesses (B2B)\",\n    \"Sellers\"\n  ],\n  \"customer_target_segments_category\": [\n    \"B2C\",\n    \"B2B\",\n    \"Retailers/Merchants\"\n  ],\n  \"business_model\": \"E-commerce, subscription services, third-party seller platform\",\n  \"business_model_category\": \"E-commerce/Retail\",\n  \"company_size_indicators_text\": \"Described as a \\\"massive online retailer\\\" with a \\\"broad global audience\\\"\",\n  \"company_size_category_inferred\": \"Large Enterprise\",\n  \"innovation_level_indicators_text\": \"Offers various digital services and platforms like Prime Video, Amazon Music, Kindle, and AWS\",\n  \"website_clarity_notes\": \"Business model and target audience are clearly described in the summary.\"\n}\n\n[List of Golden Partner Summaries]:\n1.
