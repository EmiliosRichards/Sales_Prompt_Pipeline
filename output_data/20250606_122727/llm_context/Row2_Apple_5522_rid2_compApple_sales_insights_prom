Your primary task is to analyze the provided [Target Company Attributes JSON] and a [List of Golden Partner Summaries]. Based on this, you will identify the closest matching Golden Partner, provide a match score and rationale, and generate a tailored phone sales pitch for the Target Company. Return a single, valid JSON object. Do not include any conversational preamble, summaries, or any text whatsoever outside of this JSON structure. Your response must begin with '{' and end with '}'.

**Inputs:**
1.  **Target Company Attributes:** A JSON object detailing the attributes of the company to be analyzed.
2.  **Golden Partner Summaries:** A list of concise summaries for pre-defined "Golden Partners".

**Tasks to Perform:**
1.  **Compare:** Analyze the `[Target Company Attributes JSON]` and compare it against each summary in the `[List of Golden Partner Summaries]`.
2.  **Identify Closest Match:** Determine which Golden Partner is the closest match or most relevant for comparison to the Target Company.
3.  **Score Match:** Provide a `match_score` for this closest match (e.g., an integer from 0 to 10, where 10 is a strong match, or a string like "High", "Medium", "Low").
4.  **Rationale & Features:** List the key `match_rationale_features` (as a list of strings) that make the Target Company similar to the identified closest Golden Partner, or explain the relevance of the comparison.
5.  **Generate Sales Line:** Based *only* on the `[Target Company Attributes JSON]`, craft a compelling 1-2 sentence `phone_sales_line` that could be used when calling the Target Company. This sales line should highlight aspects of their profile that align with potential needs or interests.
6.  **Other Notable Matches (Optional):** If there are other Golden Partners that are also notably similar (but not the primary match), you can list them in `other_notable_matches`. Each item in this list should be a dictionary with 'partner_name', 'score', and 'common_features'. If none, provide an empty list.


IMPORTANT: You MUST return all fields specified in the JSON structure. If a value for a field cannot be determined, return an appropriate default value, such as `null` for optional fields, an empty string `""` for text fields, or an empty list `[]` for list fields, but do not omit any fields from the final JSON object.

Remember, the entire response must be ONLY the JSON object.
The "analyzed_company_url" and "analyzed_company_attributes" fields in the example output structure are placeholders to show the full expected schema; your LLM response should generate the other fields based on the comparison and analysis.
