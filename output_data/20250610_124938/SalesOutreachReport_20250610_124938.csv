exxomove GmbH,0049 921 15 05 341,https://www.exxomove.de/,"EXXOMOVE GmbH focuses on enhancing the mobility of individuals with limited arm and hand function. The company offers two primary products: BATEO, a robotic arm designed to assist with reaching and lifting objects, and CARBONHAND, a bionic hand orthosis that provides additional strength and endurance for weak hands. These products target individuals with conditions such as muscular dystrophy, arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, and high spinal cord injuries, as well as those recovering from strokes or dealing with other conditions that impair hand and arm function. EXXOMOVE's solutions are designed to integrate with existing wheelchair controls, making them intuitive and easy to use. The BATEO robot arm is lightweight and features soft-touch fingers for secure gripping, while the CARBONHAND uses sensors to detect pressure and augment grip strength. The company emphasizes improving the quality of life and enabling greater independence for its users. They participate in various rehabilitation and assistive technology trade shows, such as REHACARE and REHAB, to showcase their products and engage with potential customers and partners. EXXOMOVE also collaborates with organizations like the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Muskelkranke e. V. (DGM) and EnableMe to reach a wider audience and provide support to individuals with disabilities. They offer consultations and product testing opportunities to help individuals determine if BATEO or CARBONHAND is right for them. The company's revenue model appears to be based on direct sales of their assistive devices. The CARBONHAND has been the subject of multiple clinical studies, demonstrating improvements in grip strength and hand functionality. The company actively promotes the CARBONHAND and BATEO through videos, user testimonials, and partnerships with rehabilitation centers.
