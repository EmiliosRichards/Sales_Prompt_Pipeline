          "text": "Your primary task is to analyze the provided [Target Company Attributes JSON] and the [List of Golden Partner Summaries]. Your goal is to identify the most relevant \"Golden Partner\" to use as an anonymous case study for a compelling, consultative sales pitch that leverages tactical empathy and modern sales techniques.\n\nReturn a single, valid JSON object. Do not include any conversational preamble, summaries, or any text whatsoever outside of this JSON structure. Your response must begin with '{' and end with '}'.\n\nInputs:\n\n  1. Target Company Attributes:\n  A JSON object detailing the attributes of the company to be analyzed.\n\n  2. Golden Partner Summaries:\n  A list of JSON objects, where each object contains the name and summary of a \"Golden Partner.\"\n\nTasks to Perform:\n\n  1. Compare:\n  Analyze the [Target Company Attributes JSON] and compare it against each summary in the [List of Golden Partner Summaries].\n\n  2. Identify Relevant Partner:\n  Determine which Golden Partner provides the most compelling basis for a sales conversation with the Target Company. This is not just about finding the closest match, but the one whose story can best be leveraged.\n\n  3. Identify Matched Partner Name:\n  Return the name of the matched partner in the `matched_partner_name` field.\n  \n  4. Score Relevance:\n  Provide a `match_score` for this relevance (e.g., a string like \"High\", \"Medium\", \"Low\").\n\n  4. Identify Key Resonating Themes:\n  List the key match_rationale_features as a list of clear, specific attributes found directly within the provided Target Company Attributes JSON. Highlight concrete similarities\u2014such as the exact business model, targeted customer segments, core products or services, or unique selling propositions\u2014that form strong common ground between the Target Company and the matched Golden Partner. These shared, explicitly identified attributes should be the basis for meaningful comparison and resonance in your sales pitch.\n\n  5. Generate Consultative Sales Line:\n  Based on the identified themes, craft a compelling 1-2 sentence phone_sales_line. This pitch must NOT mention the Golden Partner's name. Instead, it should follow a specific three-part structure:\n\n    Part 1: Demonstrate Understanding:\n    Begin by empathetically acknowledging the target company\u2019s core business attributes.\n    Example:\n    \"I was reviewing your services, and it stood out how strongly you're positioned in [Target Company's Product/Service]...\"\n\n    Part 2: Bridge to Anonymous Case Study & Highlight Outcomes:\n    Clearly highlight positive outcomes achieved through your direct involvement, referencing a single highly relevant anonymous partner.\n    Example:\n    \"...and your approach reminds me of another company we recently supported. Like you, they were committed to [Shared Attribute/Goal], and together, we substantially boosted their sales.\"\n\n    Part 3: Create the Opportunity with Smooth No-Oriented Question:\n    Conclude with a grounded, inviting, no-oriented question, subtly emphasizing your role in their achievement.\n    Example:\n    \"Would it be unreasonable to explore how we helped them achieve that success, and see if there's something valuable we could offer your team?\"\n\nIMPORTANT:\nYou MUST return all fields specified in the JSON structure. If a value for a field cannot be determined, return an appropriate default value, such as null for optional fields, an empty string \"\" for text fields, or an empty list [] for list fields, but do not omit any fields from the final JSON object.\n\n{\n  \"match_score\": \"High\",\n  \"match_rationale_features\": [\n    \"Specializes in bespoke CRM software\",\n    \"Targets mid-market B2B enterprises\",\n    \"Emphasizes highly customizable client solutions\"\n  ],\n  \"phone_sales_line\": \"I was reviewing your services, and it stood out how strongly you're positioned in customized CRM solutions for mid-market B2B enterprises. Your approach reminds me of another company we recently supported; they were equally dedicated to providing highly tailored client experiences, and together we significantly boosted their sales. Would it be unreasonable to explore how we achieved that and whether something similar could apply to your team?\",\n  \"matched_partner_name\": \"Example Partner Inc.\"\n}\n\n\nRemember, the entire response must be ONLY the JSON object. The \"analyzed_company_url\" and \"analyzed_company_attributes\" fields in the example output structure are placeholders to show the full expected schema; your LLM response should generate the other fields based on the comparison and analysis.\n\n--------TARGET COMPANY ATTRIBUTES JSON------------\n{\n  \"input_summary_url\": \"https://www.exxomove.de/\",\n  \"b2b_indicator\": false,\n  \"phone_outreach_suitability\": true,\n  \"target_group_size_assessment\": \"Appears Medium\",\n  \"industry\": \"Assistive Technology\",\n  \"products_services_offered\": [\n    \"BATEO Roboterarm\",\n    \"CARBONHAND Orthese\"\n  ],\n  \"usp_key_selling_points\": [\n    \"Increased independence and freedom for users\",\n    \"Additional strength and endurance to weak hands\",\n    \"Improved grip strength and hand functionality\",\n    \"User-friendliness and easy application\"\n  ],\n  \"customer_target_segments\": [\n    \"Individuals with limited arm and hand mobility\",\n    \"Individuals with Arthrogryposis multiplex congenitas\",\n    \"Individuals with high spinal cord injuries\",\n    \"Individuals with advanced muscular dystrophies\"\n  ],\n  \"business_model\": \"Direct sales of assistive robotic devices and orthoses to individuals and potentially institutions.\",\n  \"company_size_indicators_text\": null,\n  \"company_size_category_inferred\": \"SME\",\n  \"innovation_level_indicators_text\": \"Summary emphasizes innovation and user-friendliness in their product design, with features like easy application, washable components (for the Carbonhand), and smart control options.\",\n  \"website_clarity_notes\": \"The summary clearly communicates the company's focus and target group.
