  "summary": "EXXOMOVE GmbH is a company focused on providing solutions for individuals with limited arm and hand mobility. Their core offerings include the BATEO速 robotic arm and the CARBONHAND速 bionic hand orthosis. The BATEO速 is designed to assist individuals in performing daily tasks by providing support for reaching, gripping, and holding objects, catering to those with conditions like Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, high spinal cord injuries, or advanced muscular dystrophy. It is lightweight, easily controlled via standard wheelchair controls, and features soft-touch fingers for secure grip. The CARBONHAND速 is a microprocessor-controlled orthosis that provides additional strength and endurance to weak hands. It uses sensors to detect pressure and amplify grip, enabling users to grasp, hold, and lift objects. It is aimed at individuals with impaired hand function due to structural or functional damage, where some movement is retained. The company targets individuals with disabilities and limited mobility, as well as therapists, caregivers, and healthcare professionals involved in rehabilitation and assistive technology. Their business model appears to involve direct sales, participation in trade shows, and partnerships with distributors and therapists. EXXOMOVE emphasizes innovation and quality, with the CARBONHAND having undergone multiple clinical studies demonstrating improved grip strength and hand functionality. They actively participate in industry events like REHACARE and OTWORLD to showcase their products and engage with potential customers and partners. Their stated goal is to improve the quality of life for people with mobility impairments by providing them with assistive devices that enhance their independence and freedom.",
