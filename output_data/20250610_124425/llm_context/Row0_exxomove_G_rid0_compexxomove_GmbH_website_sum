  "summary": "EXXOMOVE GmbH is a company focused on providing solutions for individuals with limited arm and hand mobility. Their core offerings include the BATEO® Roboterarm (robotic arm) and the CARBONHAND® (bionic hand orthosis). The BATEO is designed to assist individuals in performing daily tasks by providing arm support and enabling them to reach, grasp, and hold objects. It is intended for users of electric wheelchairs and can be controlled via the wheelchair's existing controls. The CARBONHAND is a microprocessor-controlled bionic hand that provides additional strength and endurance for individuals with weak hands, enabling them to grip, hold, and lift objects. It uses sensors in the fingertips to detect pressure changes and amplify the gripping force. The Carbonhand-Orthese serves as a direct compensation for disabilities. Both products are targeted towards individuals with conditions such as Arthrogryposis multiplex congenitas, high paraplegia, or advanced muscular dystrophy. EXXOMOVE participates in various rehabilitation and assistive technology trade shows, such as REHACARE and REHAB, to showcase their products and connect with potential customers and partners. They also offer consultations and trials of their products. The company emphasizes improving the quality of life and independence for people with disabilities through their innovative mobility solutions. They also highlight scientific studies that show the effectiveness of their products, particularly the Carbonhand, in improving grip strength and hand functionality. The company's stated goal is to provide smart movement solutions that enable a self-determined life for individuals with mobility impairments.
